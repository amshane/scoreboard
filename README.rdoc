ESPN Web Developer Code Project

1. Create a HTML5 scoreboard component using the attached JSON data.

Use whatever tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, etc as you are comfortable with. Design is up to you. While we aren't expecting production-quality polish, we are expecting more than just a basic HTML list / table. Bonus points for solid test coverage!

2. Within a week, send us a URL to your project on GitHub.

Make sure the repo is public and that you include any documentation necessary to build your project in the repoâ€™s README.
